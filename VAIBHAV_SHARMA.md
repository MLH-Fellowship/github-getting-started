- Hey! I'm in Pod 24.SUM.B.3.
- We named it <strong>Majestic Lions</strong>.

## What did I learn about Github?
- Repo: A remote folder on the cloud that may/may not be connected to a local folder.
- PR: Pull Request is a request we make when we want to ask a repo admin to merge our code.
- Issues: We open them before starting/while working on our project.
  - These can be notes on the features of our product.
  - Can also open them if a bug occurs in the code.
  - Can also open to suggest changes/new features.

### Commands
- `git add .`: adds/stages all the files to be pushed to Github.
- `git commit -m "Commit Message" -m "Description"`: saves the files to be pushed to Github.
- `git push origin main`/`git push`: pushes the files to Github.
- `git status`: shows the status of the edited/modified files.
- `git branch`: shows all the branches.
- `git checkout -b <name-of-branch>`: creates a new branch with the given name and changes the working branch to this new branch.
- `git checkout <name-of-branch>`: changes the working branch to the given branch.
- `git merge <name-of-1st-branch> <name-of-2nd-branch>`: merges the two branches.

## Problems I face
- One of the main problems I face is with merge conflicts. I am usually not able to solve them correctly.
