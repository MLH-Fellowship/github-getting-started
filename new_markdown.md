### What I Learned:
> During this course, I learned the basics of using **Git** and **Github**. I learned how Git, as a version control system, allows for easy collaboration and sharing of code as well as tracking of changes to code. I learned what a Github Repository is, how to fork it, make pull requests, commit and push, as well as take advantage of branches to isolate work.
### What I am still confused about:
> I am currently not confused about anything. I feel my understanding of **Git** and **Github** is complete and if I wish to further improve my skills, I should apply my knowledge via hosting projects on Github.
