# What I Learned
I learned that Git tracks changes and supports collaboration, while GitHub offers an online interface for managing projects. Repositories store project files and histories. Cloning creates a local copy for offline work. Committing saves changes locally, and pushing uploads them to GitHub. Branches allow separate work on features or fixes. Forking lets me experiment with a copy of someone else's repository. Pull requests propose changes for feedback. Issues track tasks and bugs. I can engage with the GitHub community by starring repositories, following users, and exploring new projects.

# What I'm Still Confused About
I need to learn more about advanced Git commands like rebasing and cherry-picking. I'm not confident in handling merge conflicts. I also want to understand the best practices for collaborating on large projects, including branching strategies, code reviews, and maintaining a clean commit history.
