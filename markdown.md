## Things I Learned:

- Difference between Git and Github
- Creating and cloning github repositories and how to commit, push those changes
- Concept of branches and forking
- Github user profile and how to engage with the Github community online

## Things I am confused about:

- Proper use of github tags and how tags are different from branches
- Best security practices when it comes to using github collaboratively
- Use of some advanced commands like `git rebase` instead of `git merge`
