# New MarkDown file to learn about Github
This is my first pull request in GitHub, trying **new** stuff to familiarize with *MarkDown* syntax.

## What I've learned in this course 
- What a pull request is and how to do it
- That you can quote text in MarkDown using this syntax:
> "I really hope that this turns out how I imagine it in my head." Me, 2024

- I finally understood the purpose of creating a new branch since my previous projects were done in the main
- Also learned the purpose of *forking* a repository

## What IÂ´m still confused about
- How to properly solve any merge conflicts that a porject could encounter
- Why you must need a .gitignore file ~~why not just delete the files before doing a commit?~~
